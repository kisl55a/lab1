        "Android.\n\n"

        "Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel"
        "and other open source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as"
        "smartphones and tablets. Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the"
        "Open Handset Alliance, with the main contributor and commercial marketer being Google..\n\n"

        " "

        "Initially developed by Android Inc., which Google bought in 2005, Android was unveiled in 2007,"
        "with the first commercial Android device launched in September 2008. The current stable version "
        "is Android 10, released on September 3, 2019. The core Android source code is known as Android Open"
        "Source Project (AOSP), which is primarily licensed under the Apache License. This has allowed variants"
        "of Android to be developed on a range of other electronics, such as game consoles, digital cameras, "
        "PCs and others, each with a specialized user interface. Some well known derivatives include Android TV"
        "for televisions and Wear OS for wearables, both developed by Google.\n\n"

        " "

        "Androids source code has been used as the basis of different ecosystems, most notably that of Google which "
        "is associated with a suite of proprietary software called Google Mobile Services (GMS),[11] that frequently "
        "comes pre-installed on said devices. This includes core apps such as Gmail, the digital distribution platform "
        "Google Play and associated Google Play Services development platform, and usually apps such as the Google Chrome "
        "web browser. These apps are licensed by manufacturers of Android devices certified under standards imposed by Google. "
        "Other competing Android ecosystems include Amazon.coms Fire OS, or LineageOS. Software distribution is generally"
        "offered through proprietary application stores like Google Play Store or Samsung Galaxy Store, or open source platforms "
        "like Aptoide or F-Droid, which use software packages in the APK format.\n\n"



        "Android Inc. was founded in Palo Alto, California, in October 2003 by Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears, and Chris White."
        "Rubin described the Android project as "tremendous potential in developing smarter mobile devices that are more aware of its"
        "owners location and preferences".The early intentions of the company were to develop an advanced operating system for "
        "digital cameras, and this was the basis of its pitch to investors in April 2004. The company then decided that the market"
        "for cameras was not large enough for its goals, and by five months later it had diverted its efforts and was pitching Android"
        "as a handset operating system that would rival Symbian and Microsoft Windows Mobile. "
